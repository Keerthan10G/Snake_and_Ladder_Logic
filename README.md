<h5> It is a game with snake and ladder logic. we can choose number of players in game and start to play it!</h5>

*This is mini project which helped me to test my programming skills and understanding of oops concepts to develop this logic where it is tested by multiple test cases like different number of players (1 to 4), computer vs 1 feature, random value generating, etc...

<h4>Tools:</h4>

* Python with object oriented programming
